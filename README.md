## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently working on my python project, a battleships game. 
Expecting to be finished with my full stack within the year. 

Funfact about me, i'm an extroverted introvert who loves people,
good food good laughs and putting my nose down in code being "left alone" for hours. 
Think I found my mothership within this line of profession.
